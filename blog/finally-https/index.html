                    <p>Well, GitHub started providing HTTPS even for custom domain, So I had to enable that plus there were some internal changes which were required. Which I had done. Its been almost two years since I have bought this domain But I have been away from blogging. I had setup this a good time ago using Hugo and a cactus theme still have been struck the same place not able to write what I want or I should say not able to give to write what I want.</p>

<p>Lately, there is a lot been going in with me, in personal and professional life. I am going to spend a bit of more time here, in writing things both technical and personal, would try to write down more and more stuff so that I can take my mind of that.</p>

<p>Cool, this is, for now, let us see whether is this setup work fine and would do more config if require. Till then peace out.</p>
