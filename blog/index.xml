      <description>Some time in our projects we need data in json files(mostly web projects). But collecting and managing data in json files is harder(At least this is what I feel) compared to excel. I had recently ran into a similar situation where I need some data. Data is going to be provided by a non-technical person/client. And there going to be several rounds of it.
So I was looking for options what can be done here, where I found several online tools which could be used for same.</description>

      <description>Until now we had done as of following code. We would create couples of more functions which would help us in managing our application. As discussed earlier we would now we creating different directories and files present inside .git directory along with directory itself. More or less we would something like following directory structure after doing wag init
 .git is the git directory itself, which contains:  .git/objects/ : the object store, which weâ€™ll introduce in the next section.</description>

      <description>Last time we had created cmd_init(args) function. We add more functionality to cmd_init(args).
This was our code till last time.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  import sys import argparse argparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&amp;#34;Another Content Tracker&amp;#34;) argsubparsers = argparser.add_subparsers(title=&amp;#34;Commands&amp;#34;, dest=&amp;#34;command&amp;#34;) argsubparsers.required = True argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser(&amp;#34;init&amp;#34;, help=&amp;#34;Initialize a new, empty repository.&amp;#34;) argsp.add_argument(&amp;#34;path&amp;#34;, metavar=&amp;#34;directory&amp;#34;, nargs=&amp;#34;?&amp;#34;, default=&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;, help=&amp;#34;Where to create the repository.</description>

      <description>Second Try We would be trying to create a mini git clone from this tutorial. I aspect this to go long. In general git is awesome source code manager which is wieldy use.
So first we would be creating a lib file and executing file.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a file called wag which would have following code.
1 2 3 4  #!/usr/bin/env python3 import libwag libwag.main()   Then we would create another file which would be libwag.</description>

      <description>So I tried to follow wyag at here but I was not able to. This tutorial is great but I was not able follow it because may be I am not still not much clear with python and how it works. So after much thought I have decided that I would try to create my own blog post series where I would take learnings from wyag and try to do it in my way.</description>

      <description>Day 3 PS: These are notes, there could be grammar error and spelling errors.
Last time we were just starting with If else, the control flow,
if-else , the control flow Control flow is used when we need to do some decisive task
if, if else, if elif else statement If statement is simple as it is other language
1 2  if expression: do this  1 2 3 4  if expression: do this else: do this  1 2 3 4 5 6  if expression: do this elif expression: do this else: do this   Things to note:</description>

      <description>Day 2 PS: These are notes, there could be grammar error and spelling errors.
Last time had got until here,
We don&amp;rsquo;t need specify data type with python something similar to javascript where we use var for every type of variable.(const and let are new ES6 standards, although they are not new but new)
So basically
1 2 3  a = 10 b = 1.0 c = &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;   in above a become integer, b becomes float and c becomes string.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Installing python one can install python using package manager depending upon the operating system you are using. As I have a windows machine and ubuntu using linux on windows subsystem. I can install python from https://python.org. And Ubuntu I can use below command to install python.
1  sudo apt-get install python3   Running python To run python you would call python3 which open Python interpreter. On that you can type print(&amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;) to run your first python code which would print Hello World in next line.</description>

      <description>As part of home task part 2, we were asked to read about git log command. So this blog post is dedicated to that. To get more info about git log command I had gone through Git pro book available at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/. From this book I had followed chapter https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History to study more about git log command.
When git log is used without any argument, it displays all previous commits in reverse chronological order.</description>

This post was to be published on 19th May, instead I am writing now because of my laziness I don&amp;rsquo;t often write due to fear of writing or fear of making mistakes while write.</description>

      <guid>https://BhaveshSGupta.me/blog/reading-habit/</guid>
      <description>I am trying to develop the habit of reading. Recently while going through #dgplug summer training, there have been discussion about having a habit to read. You write 1/10th part of what you read. Reading and writing both is considered to be one of the most important part of engineer.
So trying to follow above I started reading books still non-technical but as a first step I did start. I do a lot of technical reading, but I never write about it so one of the task is to start writing about technical readings be it github projects I am going to try to write about it.</description>

      <description>This was part of one the discussion of dgplug discussion, that javascript uses utf-16 and html we usually use utf-8 as character encoding then how things work out.
This was quite interesting on how things work around because of this. So I was reading around to find answers for the above question and I landed upon this. And this text from the answer in the link helps understand how things work.</description>

      <description>So Last year in some Facebook group or somewhere I read about summer training offered by dgplug on IRC chat. I had heard about IRC chat before and had tried to use it once or twice but never tried to use it or understand it.
Technically summer trainings are usually for college students but during my college time I was too busy being in and around Microsoft Student Partner that I didn&amp;rsquo;t knew about many things around.</description>
