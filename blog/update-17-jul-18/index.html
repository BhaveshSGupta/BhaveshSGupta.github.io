<p>This blog came to life again due to dgplug summer training where we were taught to write blog post about things you are doing or learning(PS: I am yet to read logs to that class :p).
- Although I was thinking to update this as regularly as much as possible even before the training started I had planned to write down as many as things possible starting from the birthday post. I am yet to write that which would be up soon.
- I need to coverup summer training so this time I don&rsquo;t get leave behind many.
- One of the biggest confusion I have is about my career, as of now I am working as Front End Developer but I think I can&rsquo;t do that for whole life moreover I don&rsquo;t want to. I remember my college when I was not even aware about properties of body and div:P
- My competetive coding is also left behind, because of all the things around and me. I should work on that to asap tp get things align.</p>
