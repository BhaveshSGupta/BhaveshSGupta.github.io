      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time in our projects we need data in json files(mostly web projects). But collecting and managing data in json files is harder(At least this is what I feel) compared to excel. I had recently ran into a similar situation where I need some data. Data is going to be provided by a non-technical person/client. And there going to be several rounds of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I was looking for options what can be done here, where I found several online tools which could be used for same. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use that because of course privacy. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to upload an excel file to a unknown application which would process it server side give me results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
