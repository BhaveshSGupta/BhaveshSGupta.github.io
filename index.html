                            <h2>I am trying to develop the habit of reading. Recently while going through #dgplug summer training, there have been discussion about having a habit to read. You write 1/10th part of what you read. Reading and writing both is considered to be one of the most important part of engineer.
So trying to follow above I started reading books still non-technical but as a first step I did start. I do a lot of technical reading, but I never write about it so one of the task is to start writting about technical readings be it github projects I am going to try to write about it.</h2>

A brief history I had a Sony Vaio laptop with AND Radeon graphics card on it. So, it was found that it was my graphics card which is creating issue. So, I took it to many people to check what can be done this that.</h2>

This was quite intresting on how things work around because of this. So I was reading around to find answers for the above question and I landed upon this. And this text from the answer in the link helps understand how things work.</h2>

Technically summer trainings are usually for college students but during my college time I was too busy being in and around Microsoft Student Partner that I didn’t knew about many things around.</h2>

Somebody would say instead of taking so much efforts to deploy a single post you could have set up a WordPress blog which has an awesome app to add post, n number of themes, plugins, etc. But I feel I like it this way.</h2>
