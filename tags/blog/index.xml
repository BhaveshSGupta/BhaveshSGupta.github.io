      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of home task part 2, we were asked to read about git log command. So this blog post is dedicated to that. To get more info about git log command I had gone through Git pro book available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/&#34;&gt;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/&lt;/a&gt;. From this book I had followed chapter &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History&#34;&gt;https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Viewing-the-Commit-History&lt;/a&gt; to study more about git log command.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;git log&lt;/code&gt; is used without any argument, it displays all previous commits in reverse chronological order.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So another Birthday gone as-usual. Although I am not a big celebrator expect last where we had a trip to Rishikesh on my birthday PS: I am yet to write that post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My celebration to birthday most part has only dinner with family. We go to a fancy hotel have some food and come back. Its almost like this has become a tradition to celebrate birthday this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post was to be published on 19th May, instead I am writing now because of my laziness I don&amp;rsquo;t often write due to fear of writing or fear of making mistakes while write. Although I plan to write and read more. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reading Habit</title>
      <link>https://19051992.xyz/blog/reading-habit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to develop the habit of reading. Recently while going through #dgplug summer training, there have been discussion about having a habit to read. You write 1/10th part of what you read. Reading and writing both is considered to be one of the most important part of engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So trying to follow above I started reading books still non-technical but as a first step I did start. I do a lot of technical reading, but I never write about it so one of the task is to start writing about technical readings be it github projects I am going to try to write about it. May be my writing speed gets better with time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Man Who Stole My Laptop&#39;s Ferrari</title>
      <link>https://19051992.xyz/blog/the-man-who-stole-my-laptops-ferrari/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, the story goes back to 2014-2015 maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly when my laptop stopped working on later finding it was discovered the issue was with my onboard graphics card. A brief history I had a Sony Vaio laptop with AND Radeon graphics card on it. So, it was found that it was my graphics card which is creating issue. So, I took it to many people to check what can be done this that. Everyone was like your laptop won’t work or you need to do this and that. So, a friend of mine had a friend who was into laptop/computer&amp;rsquo;s business or something of that sort. So, he said let’s talk with him after inspecting he said it would cost around 6k, and it would be done. I was happy, I was not knowing much about hardware back then (although it says same even today but I know bit more). So, I gave him my laptop to get repaired.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Javascript uses utf16 and Html utf8, then how things work together?</title>
      <link>https://19051992.xyz/blog/javascript-utf16-and-html-utf8-how-things-work-together/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jul 2018 05:45:40 +0530</pubDate><author>BhaveshSGupta@disroot.org (Bhavesh S. Gupta)</author>
      <guid>https://19051992.xyz/blog/javascript-utf16-and-html-utf8-how-things-work-together/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was part of one the discussion of dgplug discussion, that javascript uses utf-16 and html we usually use utf-8 as character encoding then how things work out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was quite interesting on how things work around because of this. So I was reading around to find answers for the above question and I landed upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12114477/how-do-i-correctly-insert-unicode-in-an-html-title-using-javascript/12114520#12114520&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. And this text from the answer in the link helps understand how things work. &amp;ldquo;JavaScript string constants are parsed by the JavaScript parser. Text inside HTML tags is parsed by the HTML parser. The two languages (and, by extension, their parsers) are different, and in particular they have different ways of representing characters by character code.&amp;rdquo; Basically they won&amp;rsquo;t have issue with different character encoding as they would render same character. More over javascript parser would parse the character into the html when you use innerHTML method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So Last year in some Facebook group or somewhere I read about summer training offered by dgplug on IRC chat. I had heard about IRC chat before and had tried to use it once or twice but never tried to use it or understand it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Technically summer trainings are usually for college students but during my college time I was too busy being in and around Microsoft Student Partner that I didn&amp;rsquo;t knew about many things around. More about dgplug – Linux User’s Group of Durgapur. An inside how awesome is internet, if you want to travel to Durgapur from Gandhidham(my place) it is 2160 km. This is year training started on 17 Jun and today its already 17 July, I am always late :-D.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Static file blog using web based CMS</title>
      <link>https://19051992.xyz/blog/static-file-blog-with-web-based-cms/</link>

      <guid>https://19051992.xyz/blog/static-file-blog-with-web-based-cms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few days back I was working on a solution so that I could keep that blog updated. As this is a not-self deployable blog I actually need to deploy changes. Somebody would say instead of taking so much efforts to deploy a single post you could have set up a WordPress blog which has an awesome app to add post, n number of themes, plugins, etc. But I feel I like it this way. The geeky way of maintaining a blog :D. I was working on to find something which could help me update my blog from cell phone. For that I was able to install git on my cellphone (SU access). First how this blog actually works so there are two repository using which this blog works. One is the content management part where the content stays, theme stays and other things. And there is another repo on which there whole hugo generated HTML stays which is present on github.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://19051992.xyz/blog/finally-https/</link>

      <guid>https://19051992.xyz/blog/finally-https/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, GitHub started providing HTTPS even for custom domain, So I had to enable that plus there were some internal changes which were required. Which I had done. Its been almost two years since I have bought this domain But I have been away from blogging. I had setup this a good time ago using Hugo and a cactus theme still have been struck the same place not able to write what I want or I should say not able to give to write what I want.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://19051992.xyz/blog/first-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So finally blog is up again I have thinking to making this up long time and finally I have yay. Well I did purchase the domain in last august, I am using hugo static site generator and currently I am using customized version of cocoa-eh theme. What I like about this theme is its very simple, plain, I don&amp;rsquo;t like more fancy stuff and I could customize it as per requirement. Although I need to work a lot on this to make it more awesome and release cooca-eh-eh :-D (You never know).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
