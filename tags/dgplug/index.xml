      <description>Until now we had done as of following code. We would create couples of more functions which would help us in managing our application. As discussed earlier we would now we creating different directories and files present inside .git directory along with directory itself. More or less we would something like following directory structure after doing wag init
 .git is the git directory itself, which contains:  .git/objects/ : the object store, which weâ€™ll introduce in the next section.</description>

      <description>Last time we had created cmd_init(args) function. We add more functionality to cmd_init(args).
This was our code till last time.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  import sys import argparse argparser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=&amp;#34;Another Content Tracker&amp;#34;) argsubparsers = argparser.add_subparsers(title=&amp;#34;Commands&amp;#34;, dest=&amp;#34;command&amp;#34;) argsubparsers.required = True argsp = argsubparsers.add_parser(&amp;#34;init&amp;#34;, help=&amp;#34;Initialize a new, empty repository.&amp;#34;) argsp.add_argument(&amp;#34;path&amp;#34;, metavar=&amp;#34;directory&amp;#34;, nargs=&amp;#34;?&amp;#34;, default=&amp;#34;.&amp;#34;, help=&amp;#34;Where to create the repository.</description>

      <description>Second Try We would be trying to create a mini git clone from this tutorial. I aspect this to go long. In general git is awesome source code manager which is wieldy use.
So first we would be creating a lib file and executing file.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a file called wag which would have following code.
1 2 3 4  #!/usr/bin/env python3 import libwag libwag.main()   Then we would create another file which would be libwag.</description>

      <description>Day 4 PS: These are notes, there could be grammar error and spelling errors.
for loops For loop over a list goes as follows:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; a = [&amp;#39;Fedora&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;is&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;powerful&amp;#39;] &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; for x in a: ... print(x) ... # these ... are automatically created by python interpreter Fedora is powerful   range() function range function creates lists based on parameter passed in function``py</description>

      <description>Day 3 PS: These are notes, there could be grammar error and spelling errors.
Last time we were just starting with If else, the control flow,
if-else , the control flow Control flow is used when we need to do some decisive task
if, if else, if elif else statement If statement is simple as it is other language
1 2  if expression: do this  1 2 3 4  if expression: do this else: do this  1 2 3 4 5 6  if expression: do this elif expression: do this else: do this   Things to note:</description>

      <description>Day 2 PS: These are notes, there could be grammar error and spelling errors.
Last time had got until here,
We don&amp;rsquo;t need specify data type with python something similar to javascript where we use var for every type of variable.(const and let are new ES6 standards, although they are not new but new)
So basically
1 2 3  a = 10 b = 1.0 c = &amp;#34;test&amp;#34;   in above a become integer, b becomes float and c becomes string.</description>

      <description>Day 1 Installing python one can install python using package manager depending upon the operating system you are using. As I have a windows machine and ubuntu using linux on windows subsystem. I can install python from https://python.org. And Ubuntu I can use below command to install python.
1  sudo apt-get install python3   Running python To run python you would call python3 which open Python interpreter. On that you can type print(&amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;) to run your first python code which would print Hello World in next line.</description>

      <description>So Last year in some Facebook group or somewhere I read about summer training offered by dgplug on IRC chat. I had heard about IRC chat before and had tried to use it once or twice but never tried to use it or understand it.
Technically summer trainings are usually for college students but during my college time I was too busy being in and around Microsoft Student Partner that I didn&amp;rsquo;t knew about many things around.</description>
