      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time I had stopped optimizing this the problem more because we were having a discussion where string concatination is a costly opperation. So yesterday I was talking with Nishchay how can about the previous blog and other things at that point we started on optimizing this further avoiding string contactination as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was part of one the discussion of dgplug discussion, that javascript uses utf-16 and html we usually use utf-8 as character encoding then how things work out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This was quite interesting on how things work around because of this. So I was reading around to find answers for the above question and I landed upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12114477/how-do-i-correctly-insert-unicode-in-an-html-title-using-javascript/12114520#12114520&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. And this text from the answer in the link helps understand how things work. &amp;ldquo;JavaScript string constants are parsed by the JavaScript parser. Text inside HTML tags is parsed by the HTML parser. The two languages (and, by extension, their parsers) are different, and in particular they have different ways of representing characters by character code.&amp;rdquo; Basically they won&amp;rsquo;t have issue with different character encoding as they would render same character. More over javascript parser would parse the character into the html when you use innerHTML method.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
